Configuring your git client
===========================

 

There are three configuration items you need to use git on this project, it is
recommended you set them globally since they are almost always the same for
every project you do. Those are:

1.  Your name, set with  
    `git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"`

2.  Your email address, set with  
    `git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"`

3.  Use Visual Studio Code instead of VIM, set with  
    `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
