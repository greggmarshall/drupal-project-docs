# Acquia BLT

I first was introduced to Acquia BLT (https://github.com/acquia/blt), or Build-Launch-Test, back when it was called BOLT (not sure what the O stood for).  One of nice features of installing back then was a directory /docs that contained quite a bit of documentation in Markdown files, which we could customize for our project easily.  And the documentation stayed with the code, solving the problem of site documentation ending up in an abandoned Sharepoint or other store.

Starting with BLT 11, that directory was removed, replaced by documentation on <https://docs.acquia.com/blt>.  Given the continued evolution of BLT, that might make more sense for the BLT specific documentation.  But some of the included documentation was less BLT specific and might be useful in projects.

We went back to the last release of BLT 10 to gather that /docs directory content.  

Quite a bit of it was BLT specific and was moved to the blt-specific sub-directory.  For that documentation using the <https://docs.acquia.com/blt> documentation makes more sense, especially with the changes in BLT 11 and 12.

The more generic content was gathered into the generic sub-directory.  While there are still some references to BLT that would need to be edited out, most of the content is applicable regardless whether BLT is being used.
