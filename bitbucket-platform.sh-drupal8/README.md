# Bitbucket-Platform.sh-Drupal 8

This project was developed with a team of 6 or 7 developers, two from the client, the rest a near-shore (Mexico) development team.

### Project Set-up

- Bitbucket for Git repository
- Platform.sh for hosting
- Platform.sh was used for CI/CD

While the project was developed to be released on Drupal 8, the release date for Drupal 9 was less than a year away  so all custom code was scanned using mglaman/drupal-check to ensure it would be Drupal 9 compatible.

Documentation was created and maintained within the Git repository in a /docs directory.
