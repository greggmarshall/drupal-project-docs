## Attributions

As this documentation evolved, it became clear that trying to keep up with the ideal attributions from Creative Commons best practices for attribution at [https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/best_practices_for_attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/best_practices_for_attribution) would be impractical as text got edited and moved around. Instead, as a compromise to maintainability and ease of creation, all attribution is contained in this document and we’ve stopped trying to specifically identify what text, image, etc comes from what source.

To our knowledge all content in the documentation project comes from Creative Commons, or by extension GPL, sources. If you discover content that is not released for reuse, please let us know so we can remove it from the project.
